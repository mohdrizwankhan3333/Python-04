    "How does the recursion work, and how are the movements of disks between rods accomplished?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves moving a set of disks of different sizes from one rod to another,\n",
    "subject to the following rules:\n",
    "(i).Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "(ii).A disk can only be moved to the top of another rod if it is smaller than the disk already on the top of that rod.\n",
    "(iii).No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "The problem can be solved using recursion.\n",
    "Here's a Python implementation of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm:\n",

    "source_rod: The rod from which the disks are initially placed.\n",

    "auxiliary_rod: The auxiliary (or spare) rod that helps in the movement.\n",
    "The base case is when there's only one disk (n == 1). In this case, it directly moves the disk from the source rod to the target rod.\n",
